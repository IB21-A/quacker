Pagination:
I need to figure out how to paginate using javascript and the django API

It generally seems I should be using javascript to generate the HTML on the front end for dynamic content


Maybe I can use data- attributes for javascript to be able to get post id's etc when liking a post generated by Django template?


Displaying pages- should I be clearing the content and generating new content?



For now lets build tweets in JS and add the like buttons there
